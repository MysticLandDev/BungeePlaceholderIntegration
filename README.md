# BungeePlaceholderIntegration
PlaceholderAPI Support for BungeeCord.

I didn't find this anywhere. I only found [this](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/issues/36) closed Feature Request, but nothing else.

To use it, just put the latest JAR from [here](https://github.com/booky10/BungeePlaceholderIntegration/releases) in your BungeeCord plugins folder and the same one again, in your [Bukkit](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit), [Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot) or [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads) plugins folder.
